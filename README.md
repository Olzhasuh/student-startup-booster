Student Startup Booster

This is a simple decentralized application (dApp) for supporting student startups using Ethereum.

The idea is very straightforward:

students can create startup campaigns

other users can support them by sending ETH

supporters receive ERC-20 reward tokens for their contribution

The project is built as a final university project and demonstrates basic blockchain concepts.
